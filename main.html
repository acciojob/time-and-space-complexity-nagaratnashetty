	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph about Time Complexity -->
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. It helps us determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time. Efficient algorithms are those that can handle large inputs quickly.</p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph about Space Complexity -->
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. For instance, an algorithm with a space complexity of <code>O(n)</code> means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.</p>
